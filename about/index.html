		<p> We believe building websites should be simple for developers. You shouldn't have read pages of documentation just to build a simple website. You shouldn't have to worry if installing a plugin is going to make your site vulnerable or unscalable. And you certainly shouldn't be hesitant to make an update because it might break something on the live website.</p>

		<p> We love static websites because they're: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fast to build</li>
			<li>Simple</li>
			<li>Scalable</li>
			<li>Secure</li>
			<li>Source control backed</li>
			<li>Powerful - with <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">static site generators</a> and <a target="_blank"  href="http://cloudcannon.com/tips/2014/12/12/the-ultimate-list-of-services-for-static-websites.html">3rd party plugins</a>, there's not a lot you can't do  </li>
		</ul>

			<p> Our mission is to bring static websites to the mainstream. CloudCannon unites developers and non-technical content editors by providing the best of both worlds.  Developers build static websites to gain all the advantages listed above. Non-technical content writers can make updates quickly and easily without any coding. </p>
