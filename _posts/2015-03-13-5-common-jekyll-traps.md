Now there are some decent guides I guess but when I was starting there was no solid guide to explain how it worked, there was a lot of assumed knowledge from being a Ruby developer even though I used Jekyll as a web designer. Setting Jekyll up in Windows is also painful on its own (I don't use Windows primarily but used Jekyll in a coding workshop I gave, not everyone has a Mac)"

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll.

I asked them what problems they encountered when they first started using Jekyll. I have some suggestions on where to look for help if you are stuck. <!-- excerpt stop -->

I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll community. I asked them to share their opinions and experiences of Jekyll. Last week I shared their top [5 most common reasons for loving Jekyll](http://cloudcannon.com/jekyll/2015/03/04/5-reasons-you-should-use-jekyll.html).

The natural follow up question to &#39;what works?&#39; is &#39;what doesn&#39;t?&#39;. But I didn&#39;t want to ask that question - it&#39;s rather un-constructive. Instead I think new users might be more encouraged to hear the initial hurdles other users have overcome to get started. If they can overcome their&#39;s so might you Jekyll padawan!

So without further ado*...

*and remembering that some users began years ago and the Jekyll dev&#39;s have been doing a great job of fixing these issues or [have plans to](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3324).

My second big survey question was **&quot;What was the first roadblock/hurdle/facepalm moment you had to overcome to begin using Jekyll?&quot;**

#### The TL;DR:

Top 5 most common Jekyll hurdles starting out:

1.  Initial setup is a pain (getting dev environment just right)
2.  Understanding site structure
3.  Windows support
4.  Compile speed
5.  GUI lacking (command line interface scares some users)

#### Help for getting through these initial Jekyll issues:

Identifying shared initial frustrations with Jekyll might make you feel better about encountering them. Better than a problem shared though is a problem solved! Below is a collection of info on identified issues:

**Initial setup is a pain (getting dev environment just right)**

1.  The Jekyll Core Team is putting lots of effort into making local installs easier. [Have your say on a solution](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/poll-installation-priorities-for-3-0/106)
2.  Watch Travis Neilson&#39;s [AWESOME intro video for local installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc).
3.  Move your compile to the cloud. See CloudCannon notes below.

**Understanding site structure**

1.  The [Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) do cover this well so give them another read.
2.  Andrew Munsell&#39;s [Jekyll by Example](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial) tutorial gives a great overview of concepts in action. _Another alternative for a fully explained build is the older [Yes We Jekyll](http://yeswejekyll.com/). (16/3 suggested by @parkr)_
3.  _If the powerful &#39;collections&#39; feature is confusing you&nbsp;check out this&nbsp;recent guide by @BenBalter:&nbsp;[Explain like I&rsquo;m five: Jekyll collections](http://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/).&nbsp;(16/3&nbsp;great&nbsp;suggestion by @AlWillis)_

**Windows support**

1.  This is the [official-unofficial guide by @juthilo](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)

**Compile speed**

1.  Not a lot of quick wins available here at the moment, but it has been and is a top priority for the Jekyll Core Team. In fact in the [latest Jekyll 3.0.0 beta release notes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/v3.0.0.beta1/History.markdown#head) incremental regeneration is item number one.

**GUI lacking (command line interface scares some users)**

1.  [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) is a solution that some Jekyll users have turned to to assist with editing markdown and the publishing process.
2.  CloudCannon is looking to nail this! See below.

#### In their own words:

**&quot;What was the first roadblock/hurdle/facepalm moment you had to overcome to begin using Jekyll?&quot;**

#### Plug from CloudCannon:

Avoid the initial Jekyll environment setup by moving your compilation to the cloud. Add non-tech friendly GUIs to your Jekyll workflow. Check out [CloudCannon&#39;s Jekyll beta overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjd0V_pET5E) and then [join the beta](http://app.cloudcannon.com/jekyll_beta).
