		<p>
			We believe building websites should be simple for developers.
			You shouldn't have to read pages of documentation just to build a simple website.
			You shouldn't have to worry if installing a plugin is going to make your site vulnerable or unscalable.
			You certainly shouldn't be hesitant to make an update because it might break something on the live website.
		</p>

		<p>We love static websites because they're:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fast to build</li>
			<li>Simple</li>
			<li>Scalable</li>
			<li>Secure</li>
			<li>Source control backed</li>
			<li>Powerful - with <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">static site generators</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://cloudcannon.com/tips/2014/12/12/the-ultimate-list-of-services-for-static-websites.html">third party plugins</a>, there's not a lot you can't do</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Our mission is to bring static websites to the mainstream. CloudCannon unites developers and non-developers by providing the best of both worlds. Developers build static websites to gain all the advantages listed above. Non-developers can make updates quickly and easily without any coding.</p>
