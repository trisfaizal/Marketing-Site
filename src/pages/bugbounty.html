    content_markdown: Static sites are just HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. This means they're faster to build, require less technical knowledge, need less upkeep and are future proofed.
  - title: Scalability
    icon: trending_up
    content_markdown: A single webserver can handle [a lot](http://www.speedemy.com/apache-vs-nginx-2015/) of traffic if it's only serving static content.
  - title: Speed
    content_markdown: With static there's no database queries or page to generate on-the-fly. All the web server needs to do is return a static file.

  - title: Security
    content_markdown: A static site is as secure as the web server its running on which makes them significantly less vulnerable to hackers.
    icon: lock
  - title: Stability
    content_markdown: There's fewer points of failure with static sites so it's likely your uptime will be much higher.
    icon: all_inclusive
  - title: Source controlled
    content_markdown: The entire site and content can live in a source control system such as Git. This gives you many advantages such as backups, approval processes and collaboration tools.
