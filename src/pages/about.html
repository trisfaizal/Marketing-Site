<div class="about">
	<div class="wrapper first">
		<!--h1>CloudCannon is a new kind of CMS for the static site generator, Jekyll.</h1> -->
		<h2>What drives us</h2>
		<p>Our mission is to bring all the advantages of static technology to developers while giving editors intuitive interfaces and workflows to update content. We believe most informational websites should be static. The reason they’re not is non-technical editors need to update content.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="wrapper minimal">
		<h2>Our team</h2>
		<p>Founded in Dunedin, New Zealand and now serving customers from all over the world. Our team is passionate about doing our part in making static site generators mainstream.</p>
