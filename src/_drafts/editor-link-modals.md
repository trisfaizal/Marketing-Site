Front matter is a great way to structure content and metadata for a Jekyll website. We've made some updates to allow you to further integrate your front matter into your editing experience.

## Sidebar and Editor Links

The right sidebar is the default place to edit your front matter in the *Visual* and *Content Editors*. CloudCannon builds an easy to use interface around each of your fields, controlled by a intuitive naming scheme. With larger sets of front matter, it's sometimes difficult for editors to connect where the changes appear. *Editor Links* help bridge this context gap.

Editor Links are contextual pointers to front matter fields and other pages in the *Visual Editor*. The default behaviour of a front matter *Editor Link* is to highlight the associated front matter field in the sidebar. For example, an **Edit Title** button that highlights the `page.title` field so editors know where to change it.

> *Editor Links* can be styled to fit the brand of your site, and are not displayed on your live site.

## Modals

We've added the option to have *Editor Links* open front matter fields in a modal pop up instead of highlighting the field in the sidebar. Use this option to keep your editors inside the *Visual Editor* where context is at its peak.

> Modals display the linked field only and provide more screen space than the sidebar. This is particularly useful with *Rich Text* fields.

![Example modal front matter Editor Link](/images/blog/editor-link-modals/modal-editor-link.png){: .screenshot srcset="/images/blog/editor-link-modals/modal-editor-link.png 800w, /images/blog/editor-link-modals/modal-editor-link@2x.png 1600w"}

Open *Editor Links* in a modal by setting the `data-cms-editor-link-style` attribute to **modal**, or by hiding them in the sidebar.

```html
<a href="cloudcannon:#title" data-cms-editor-link-style="modal">Edit the title</a>
```

## Hiding fields

You can hide specific fields in the sidebar to prevent changes from editors, or to move front matter editing into modals.

> *Editor Links* pointing to hidden fields will open in a modal as they can't be highlighted in the sidebar.
{: .explainer}

Hide fields by prefixing the key with an underscore (e.g. `_hidden_text`) or with [editing options](https://docs.cloudcannon.com/editing/options/#hidden-fields) (e.g. setting `_options.layout.hidden` to **true**).
